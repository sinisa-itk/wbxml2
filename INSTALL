  WBXML Library INSTALLATION OVERVIEW
  
  Dependencies
  ------------
  
    The WBXML library needs the Expat XML Parser library to convert XML to WBXML
    (http://expat.sourceforge.net)
    
    On Linux Debian, just type:
    $ apt-get install libexpat1-dev
  
  Unix(Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris)
  ---------------------------
    
    libwbxml is using CMake as "build environment" (http://www.cmake.org).
    You must have cmake 2.4+. For example, on Debian:
    $ apt-get install cmake

    We only support/test "out of source builds", which means you have to create a 
     separated build directory.

    Example 1:

        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$prefix /path/to/libwbxml/source/
        make
        make test
        make install

    Example 2:

        cd /path/to/libwbxml/source/
        cmake . -B/tmp/build/libwbxml
        cd /tmp/build/libwbxml
        make
        make test
        make install

  Windows
  -------
  
    The Win32 binary of Expat library is in: "/win32/expat"
  
     Just open the 'win32/libwbxml.dsw' VC++ workspace, and build:
     
        - libwbxml2.dll : Main WBXML engine - Parser and Encoder (needs Expat for XML to WBXML conversion)
        - wbxml2xml.exe : WBXML to XML converter tool
        - xml2wbxml.exe : XML to WBXML converter tool

  Symbian
  -------
    
     You must have the "Nokia S60 SDK v1.2" installed.
     
     You must have the Expat library (ported to Symbian) installed.
     
     Go to 'symbian/' folder and type:
     c:\Symbian\libwbxml\symbian> bldmake bldfiles
     c:\Symbian\libwbxml\symbian> abld build wins deb
