2012-07-20  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * libwbxml2.pc only depends on expat. It does not depend on libxml2.
    The cmake module was fixed too.
  * Install FindLibWbxml2.cmake during "make install" (ticket #83).
    The external cmake modules are now included at cmake/modules
    because the cmake directory includes a CMakeLists.txt.
  * Removed outdated test/test_parser.c (ticket #82).

2012-05-25  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.11.1
  * Fixed performance problem during the generation of XML documents.
    Committed the original patch from ticket #81.
    The patch was supplied by Conrad Irwin.
  * The parameter malloc_block of the function wbxml_buffer_create_real
    is only used now for the initial memory allocation. The patch for
    ticket #80 introduced a more agressive algorithm for memory
    re-allocation to support big files.
  * Fixed performance problem during the parsing of XML documents.
    Committed the original patch from ticket #80.
    The patch was supplied by Conrad Irwin.
  * Extract node breaks (null'ed) the previous node link to a next node
    (too early cleanup in wbxml_tree_extract_node of wbxml_tree.c).
    The patch was supplied by Mark Ostrer from Websense (ticket #79).
  * Added a trailing newline to the files THANKS and TODO (ticket #77).
  * The tool xml2wbxml is now covered by LGPL v2.1 (or any later).
    Petr Pisar discovered that wbxml2xml and xml2wbxml used different
    licences.  This was a mistake. Aymerick Jehanne and Michael Bell
    (the copyright holders) agreed on using LGPL as licence.
    (ticket #76)

2011-08-06  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.11.0
  * This is an exact copy of 0.11.beta6.

2011-06-06  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.11.beta6
  * Fixed handling of base64 encoded data in elements which are flagged
    as WBXML_TAG_OPTION_BINARY. The base64 encoded data is only decoded
    when all data is present (ticket #75).
  * Added two new internal functions for the encoding and decoding of
    base64 in a buffer (including cleanup of wbxml_encoder.c). The
    decoder function supports formatted base64 strings too
    (e.g. blanks, tabs and newlines).
  * Added test for ticket #75 (formatted base64 string in binary tag).
  * Failing tests do no longer remove their temporary data.
  * Fixed wrong opaque conversion from WBXML to XML (never normalize
    opaque/binary data).
  * Added a new error code for the base64 decoder only. The decoder
    used the same error code and message like the encoder until now.
  * Added flag WBXML_TAG_OPTION_BINARY to tag MIME of ActiveSync code
    page CompseMail:.
  * Fixed otion -a of xml2wbxml (-a was not allowed as option).
  * Added two tests for ActiveSync command SendMail.
  * Fixed usage of strncasecmp and location of a variable definition
    (changes from ticket #73).
    This fixes some compiler errors from MS VisualStudio C++ 2010.
    The patch was supplied by Boaz Yaniv.

2011-04-27  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.11.beta5
  * Fixed an inconsistency in the naming conventions of the new
    functions.

2011-04-19  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.11.beta4
  * Added option -a to xml2wbxml (anonymous format). The public ID is
    set to unknown and the DTD is not included.

2011-04-14  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.11.beta3
  * Some defines were added again to support the old libwbxml 0.9.2
    interface. This fixes mainly some names of parameter types.
    You can compile libsyncml like follows:
    CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include/libwbxml-1.0/wbxml" cmake . -B/tmp/build/libsyncml
  * If the XML root element must be used to identify the WBXML language
    then the name space is scanned before the root element itself.
    All SyncML versions use the same root element. Nevertheless it is
    better to set the document type correctly.
  * Fixed literal tag encoding. The element name and not the namespace
    must be encoded.
  * Added ActiveSync support with Microsoft's original namespaces.

2011-01-25  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.11.beta2
  * The WBXML converter interface is now more robust in terms of new
    parameters and binary downward compatibility.
  * Added workaround for Nokia bug. Some Nokia software does not only
    encode the name space in the public ID. It also stores the name
    space in the root element as an attribute with an attribute name
    as literal reference zero but without a string table and the name
    space as an inline string.
    (Example: 04 00 03 string 00 => LITERAL index[0] STR_I string \0)
  * Every enum element has a fixed number.
  * Fixed SO-naming.

2011-01-20  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.11.beta1
  * Changed the location of the header files including the installation
    path to support several versions of the library at the same host
  * Header files are installed to separate directory wbxml/
  * Reduced API (removed 14 header files from installation)
  * Removed unused parameter node from parse_cdata in wbxml_encoder.c.
    (ticket #43)
  * Fixed unused parameter warnings from expat callbacks.
    (ticket #47, #48 and #49)
  * Fixed wrong detection of WBXML language table list end.
    (ticket #44 and #45)
  * Added support for opaque tokens (e.g. byte arrays from Microsoft
    ActiveSync, code page Email2 ConversationId and ConversationIndex)
    (ticket #55). The original patch was supplied by Amnon Aaronsohn.
  * Added new parameter -c for character set specification to wbxml2xml
    (ticket #52)
  * Added support for setting the character set in the transport
    meta-information. This means that it is possible to set the
    character set via the interface. Please note that you cannot
    enforce a character set. (ticket #52)

2011-01-08  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.10.9
  * Added correct default behaviour to parse_charset. If no character
    set is specified in a WBXML document then UTF-8 is assumed until
    there is another specification in the transport meta-information.
    (ticket #52)
  * Fixed integer overflow in opaque data parsing (ticket #54).
    The patch was supplied by Amnon Aaronsohn.
  * Fixed iconv support (ticket #52)
  * Added several tokens for Microsoft ActiveSync v14.0 revision 8.0
    (ticket #53). The patch was supplied by Amnon Aaronsohn.
  * Fixed wrong WBXML table token for OMA DM DDF (ticket #51)
  * Fixed unsigned integer overflow (patch from ticket #41)
    The overflow causes crashs or wrong wbxml messages.
  * Fixed locations of variable definitions and replaced strtoull by
    strtoul (changes from ticket #42 and #50).
    This fixes some compiler errors from MS VisualStudio 2008 and 9.0.
  * Added support for recursion in wbxml_tree_node_elt_get_from_name
    (ticket #46)

2010-03-29  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.10.8
  * Removed OMA DM tests because the OMA did not grant a permission
    for the inclusion (ticket #36).
  * Added a fix for the broken vFormat handling in the SyncML
    specification. All LFs are replaced by CRLFs in every vFormat
    object inside a SyncML message (ticket #38).
  * Added Nokia ConML support (ticket #35).
    There is no public documentation available from Nokia. The
    transformation tables were created from sniffed WBXML documents.
    The patch was supplied by Anton D. Kachalov.

2009-05-12  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.10.7
  * Fixed a Debian MIPS port build issue (ticket #34)
    If the operating system environment has a built-in getopt
    implementation then the cmake environment disables the internal
    implementation of libwbxml and uses the getopt function of the
    operating system. This avoids clashes with variables which are
    declared extern and explicit but already exists in the default
    POSIX header files (e.g. optopt).

2009-04-24  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.10.6
  * Extended (updated) tables for Microsoft AirSync
    (The patch was supplied by Ossi Jormakka from Ixonos Plc.)
  * Expat splits &lt;html&gt; into three separate text nodes.
    Therefore it is necessary to scan for splitted text nodes
    and merge them into a single consistent text node. 
  * Normalize encoding with normalize_xml.pl 
  * Fixed bashisms in launchTest.sh
  * Fixed Sun Studio CC and GCC warnings.
  * Fixed Testing.cmake to not set GCC specific compiler and linker
    flags for other compilers.
  * Fixed race condition in WV datetime opaque encoding

2009-03-30  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.10.5
  * Fixed library installation path for win32 (ticket #31)
    (The patch was supplied by Jeremy Laine.)

2009-03-09  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.10.4
  * Fixed the byte order of the WV datetime opaque encoding (the bytes
    were written in the reversed order)
  * Fixed the time zone byte handling in the WV datetime opaque encoding
    (e.g. A means UTC+1, Z must be 0x5a) (ticket #30)
  * Added correct timezone handling for WV datetime opaque parser
  * Added support for WV datetime inline encoding. All timestamps which
    use the full ISO style like 2001-09-12T13:09:12+02:00 are encoded
    as inline strings. This style is strongly recommended because time
    zones like UTC+09:30 of Darwin in Australia are supported too.
    (ticket #30)
  * Added support for an EXPECTED value to the XML normalization script

2009-02-17  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.10.3
  * Added support for SourceParent in SyncML 1.1.
    This is a proprietary extension to support things like the SMS and
    bookmark synchronization of Nokia.

2009-02-06  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.10.2
  * Added support for OMA DM DDF 1.2 (ticket #7).
  * DRMREL 1.0 test cases were disabled because of the poor
    specification (e.g. hard coded names for XML namespaces and
    definition of such namespaces as (WB)XML attributes).
  * The generated XML documents of the most tests (conversion from XML
    to WBXML back to XML) are compared with the original documents.
    Only special tests are not covered (e.g. hexadecimal number
    conversion, SyncML CDATA usage). 
  * If there is no PUBLIC ID then DOCTYPE must include PUBLIC "" or
    SYSTEM. libwbxml always adds SYSTEM in this case.
  * Fixed datetime support for Wireless Village (ticket #27).
  * Extension tokens must not be replaced within normal text data
    (ticket #26).
  * Ticket #13 was rejected because the mentioned specification is only
    a today outdated OMA change request. Perhaps a new specification
    must be implemented in case of a new request. 
  * Created a script to normalize XML documents.
  * The getopt implementation was replaced because of a potential
    license issue. This fixed a Solaris build issue too (ticket #25).

2009-01-06  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.10.1
  * Removed a useless buffer which only creates a memory leak.
  * The installation of the documentation can be disabled.
  * LIBDATA_INSTALL_DIR was introduced (used by pkgconfig). 
  * All tests are executed as standalone tests to get more
    detailed informations if a test fails.
  * The timezone of the nightly build-time was fixed.

2008-12-05  Michael Bell <michael.bell@web.de>
  * Released 0.10.0
  * Fixed ticket #14 with patch from ticket
    (hexadecimal integer support for Wireless-Village)
  * Added datetime encoding support for Wireless-Village.
    (The encoder can tolerate missing seconds like in the tests.)
  * Tests were integrated and can be used via make test.
  * Build system switched to cmake from GNU autotools.
  * Size changed to MaxSize in OMA DS 1.2 DevInf
  * Fixed a couple of issues with SyncML, by Michael Bell
  * Fixed segfault in wbxml_encoder.c
      - Thanks Stijn van Drongelen
  * Added Sax like entity parsing
  * Miscellaneous build fixes and anonymous document support
  * Namespaces support
  * Some more cleanup and bug fixes

2008-11-21  Aymerick Jehanne <aymerick@jehanne.org>

2005-11-28  Aymerick Jehanne <aymerick@jehanne.org>
  * SyncML 1.2 support
  * Improved WBXMLTree API
  * New encoder 'flow mode'
  * Back to LGPL licence

2005-05-23  Aymerick Jehanne <aymerick@jehanne.org>
  * wbxml_tables.c: Added the 'WBXML_SUPPORT_PROV_11' flag to activate
    OMA PROV 1.1 tables. There is no new Public ID defined to OMA PROV 1.1.
    I don't know how to handle this, so for the moment I apply the OMA PROV 1.1
    tables modifications directly into OMA PROV 1.0 tables.

2005-04-01  Aymerick Jehanne <aymerick@jehanne.org>
  * wbxml_parser.c: Corrected a bug when Public ID is in string table.
    Handle phones that don't end string table with a terminating NULL char.
    Removed some potential memory leaks.

2005-03-29  Aymerick Jehanne <aymerick@jehanne.org>
  * wbxml_tree.[h|c]: Added wbxml_tree_node_have_child_elt()
  * wbxml_encoder.c: Added WBXML_ENCODER_XML_NO_EMPTY_ELT_INDENT
    to disable indent of elements that do not have child elements, for
    a more readable XML generation. This flag should be replaced by
    a configuration var later.

2005-03-20  Aymerick Jehanne <aymerick@jehanne.org>

  * src/wbxml_parser.c: Fixed bug [1080489] (thanks to Rasmus Lock Larsen)
  * src/wbxml_encoder.c: Added a 'WBXML_ENCODER_XML_GEN_EMPTY_ELT' flag
    to enable generation of '<foo />' instead of '<foo></foo>'. This flag
    should be replace to a configuration var later.

2005-02-23  Aymerick Jehanne <aymerick@jehanne.org>
  * src/wbxml_tree.[h|c] : Added wbxml_tree_node_destroy_all().

      then added two macros to permit wbxml_conv.h interface
      backward compatibility
    * src/wbxml_encoder.c: Fixed a bug that produced non valid XML
      by not replacing '<' and '&' characters to their entity values

      Accuracy and Cpriority presence attributes 
      in decode_wv_content() (thanks to Erik).
    * src/wbxml_parser.c: Modified decode_wv_integer()
      to allow decoding of '0 length' integers

2003-05-22  Aymerick Jehanne <libwbxml@jehanne.org>
    * Added support of Ericsson / Nokia OTA Settings v7.0. Thanks
      to Nicolas Bougues for the hints.
    * src/wbxml.h : Added WBXML_LANG_OTA_SETTINGS.
    * src/wbxml_tables.[h|c] : Added tables for OTA Settings.
    * src/Makefile.am : Added WBXML_LANG_OTA_SETTINGS compilation flag.
    * INSTALL : Added documentation of WBXML_LANG_OTA_SETTINGS.
    * src/wbxml_tables.h : Added a true value for WBXML_PUBLIC_ID_WV_CSP11,
      as found at 'http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/omna/
      omna-wbxml-public-docid.htm'. XML Public ID is different too... maybe
      we have to switch to it... one day

2003-05-02  Aymerick Jehanne <libwbxml@jehanne.org>
    * Added compilation flag WBXML_ENCODER_USE_STRTBL. If not defined,
      the String Table mecanism is not used (but it is still used
      for unknown WBXML Public ID).

2003-05-01  Aymerick Jehanne <libwbxml@jehanne.org>
    * src/wbxml.h: Added a new enum 'WBXMLLanguage' to identify
      each language supported. So that we don't rely on WBXML Public
      ID (some languages doesn't have one).
    * src/wbxml_tables.[h|c]: Modified 'WBXMLLangEntry' structure to
      associate a 'WBXMLLanguage' for each language. Added a new
      function wbxml_tables_get_wbxml_publicid() to get the WBXML
      Public ID of a given Language.
    * src/wbxml_parser.[h|c]: 
        - Use the new 'WBXMLLanguage' enum.
        - Added a new parameter to wbxml_parser_parse_to_tree() to
      force to parse the document to a given Language.
        - Added wbxml_parser_set_language() that replaces the old
      wbxml_parser_set_wbxml_public_id().
        - Changed wbxml_parser_get_wbxml_public_id() and
      wbxml_parser_get_xml_public_id() behaviour.
    * src/wbxml_encoder.c: Use the new 'WBXMLLanguage' enum.
    * conv/wbxml_conv.h: Added the 'lang' parameter to 
      WBXML2XMLParameters structure.
    * conv/wbxml2xmlc.: Use wbxml_parser_set_language() in Direct Mode.
      Use the new parameter of wbxml_parser_parse_to_tree() in Tree Mode.
    * tools/wbxml2xml_tool.c: Added '-l' option so that the user can
      force parsing of document to a given Language.
    * win32/*.dsp, conv/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, tools/Makefile.am,
      tools/wbxml2xml_tool.c, src/wbxml.h, src/wbxml_errors.h,
      src/wbxml_log.h, src/wbxml_encoder.c, src/wbxml_errors.c,
      src/wbxml_log.c, wbxml_parser.c, wbxml_tables.c: Added compilation
      flags for selecting supported languages.

2003-04-30  Aymerick Jehanne <libwbxml@jehanne.org>
    * src/wbxml.h : Added #pragma for WIN32 plateform, so that
      some hidden warnings generate errors. Thanks to Ramki for
      it's ARM compilation support ;)
    * src/*, conv/*, tools/* : Modified numerous files to
      correct this 'new' errors. Modified some structures (mainly
      in 'src/wbxml_tables.h', and added some macro for automatic
      casts so that we don't have to modify the API. Most of the
      modifications concern WB_TINY to WB_UTINY casts.

2003-04-26  Aymerick Jehanne <libwbxml@jehanne.org>
    * New release of wbxml2: 0.7.2

2003-04-26  Aymerick Jehanne <libwbxml@jehanne.org>
    * src/wbxml.h: Casted strlen(), strdup(), strcmp(), strncmp()
      and strstr() parameters to (const char*) in macros.
    * src/wbxml_tables.[h|c]: Added function 
      wbxml_tables_contains_attr_value_from_xml()
    * wbxml_encoder.c: 
        - Changed WBXML_ENCODER_STRING_TABLE_MIN to '3'.
        - In wbxml_strtbl_collect_strings(): check if the attribute
          value is tokenisable before adding it to string table.
        - In wbxml_encode_value_element_buffer(): corrected a bug 
          when splitting the buffer for String Table elements

      String Table

2003-04-24  Aymerick Jehanne <libwbxml@jehanne.org>
    * Changed 'CR-LF' to 'LF' in all source files and Makefiles.
      This should permits Linux users to compile normally.
      Thanks to Jannes Faber for finding this solution.

2003-04-19  Aymerick Jehanne <libwbxml@jehanne.org>
    * Added Parsing of WV DateTime - Encoding not yet finished

2003-03-24  Aymerick Jehanne <libwbxml@jehanne.org>
    * wbxml_tables.[c|h]: wbxml_tables_get_attr_from_xml(): modified for
      better behaviour. Now it returns the attribute value part that is
      not included in Attribute Token returns.
    * wbxml_encoder.c: Now use wbxml_tables_get_tag_from_xml() and
      wbxml_tables_get_attr_from_xml().
    * conv/xml2wbxml_clb.c: Modification due to changes of
      wbxml_tables_get_attr_from_xml() prototype.

2003-03-23  Aymerick Jehanne <libwbxml@jehanne.org>
    * wbxml_tables.[h|c]: Added Wireless-Village 1.2 tokens. This is taken
      from a Beta spec from OMA that contains some bugs. Hope this will be
      corrected in next release of the spec. Corrected XML Public ID and
      DTD of OMA WV 1.1.
