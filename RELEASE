Making a release
===

To make a release of libwbxml, do the following:

 - check out a fresh copy from subversion

 - increment the version numbers in ./CMakeLists.txt: 

   Package Version:
   LIBWBXML_VERSION_MAJOR
   LIBWBXML_VERSION_MINOR
   LIBWBXML_VERSION_PATCH

   Library Version:
   LIBWBXML_LIBVERSION_AGE 
    * Increment if any interface changed since last release.

   LIBWBXML_LIBVERSION_REVISION
    * Increment if any library code changed since last release.
      Set to 0 if any interface  has been changed since last release.

   LIBWBXML_LIBVERSION_AGE
    * Reset to 0 if any interface has been removed since last release.
      If any interface has been added incremnt.


 - Run "make test" again several times to try to see race conditions.

 - Commit the increased version changes (and build fixes)

 - if someone else made changes and the commit fails,
   you have to "svn up" and run the tests again

 - once the commit succeeds, "svn cp trunk tags/libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINJOR.$PATCH"

 - create tarballs with "cmake $SOURCES; make package_source" (out of source build!)

 - write checksums with md5sum from the tarballs to a file with the
   same name like the tarballs without the tar and compression suffixes
   and plus a new suffix md5sum
   Example:
     md5sum libwbxml-0.10.0.tar.* > libwbxml-0.10.0.md5sum
     md5sum -c libwbxml-0.10.0.md5sum

 - upload the tarballs and the checksum file to releases.
   make sure the version numbers are the same!

 - Annouce the release on the mailing list
   Tips: 
     * make diff of the exported symbols "nm -g -P libwbxml.so"
     * read svn log
